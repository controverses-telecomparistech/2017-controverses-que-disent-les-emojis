Six studies involving 1087 consumers in USA and China were conducted using names of foods and beverages as the stimuli. On average consumers selected 1–2 emoji per stimulus. The elicited data was able to discriminate between stimuli that span the hedonic continuum and generate detailed emotional product profiles. Less discrimination was obtained between hedonically similar stimuli, but meaningful emotional profiles were elicited nonetheless. Repeatability of emoji responses was high and data with good face validity was obtained from American and Chinese consumers. Emoji responses from groups of consumers who liked/disliked a focal stimulus were different (in the expected directions) and frequency of consumption also influenced emoji responses.

Various word-based questionnaires for direct measurement exist and an emoji variant was recently proposed. Herein, emotion words are replaced with emoji conveying a range of emotions. Further assessment of emoji questionnaires is needed to establish their relevance in food-related consumer research. Methodological research contributes hereto and in the present research the effects of question wording and response format are considered. Specifically, a web study was conducted with Chinese consumers (n = 750) using four seafood names as stimuli (mussels, lobster, squid and abalone). Emotional associations were elicited using 33 facial emoji. Explicit reference to “how would you feel?” in the question wording changed product emoji profiles minimally. Consumers selected only a few emoji per stimulus when using CATA (check-all-that-apply) questions, and layout of the CATA question had only a small impact on responses. A comparison of CATA questions with forced yes/no questions and RATA (rate-all-that-apply) questions revealed an increase in frequency of emoji use for yes/no questions, but not a corresponding improvement in sample discrimination. For the stimuli in this research, which elicited similar emotional associations, RATA was probably the best methodological choice, with 8.5 emoji being used per stimulus, on average, and increased sample discrimination relative to CATA (12% vs. 6–8%). The research provided additional support for the potential of emoji surveys as a method for measurement of emotional associations to foods and beverages and began contributing to development of guidelines for implementation."","""",""2017-05-10 09:16:41"",""2017-05-10 09:16:41"",""2017-05-10 09:16:41"","""","""","""","""","""",""Food Research International"",""A comparison of five methodological variants of emoji questionnaires for measuring product elicited emotional associations"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""ScienceDirect"","""","""","""",""C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\2MSE9Z8A\Ares et Jaeger - A comparison of five methodological variants of em.pdf"	" C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\2GW8SRFW\S0963996917301898.html"","""","""",""China"	 Consumers	 emoticons	 Emotion measurement	 Research methods	" Seafood"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

This indicates a potential to harness emoji for use in consumer research. However, little is known about how consumers interpret emoji and what meanings are associated to different emoji. In a study of 33 facial emoji, conducted with Chinese consumers (n=1084), the present research begins to close this knowledge gap. Data were collected in an online survey that asked participants to select words they perceived as being applicable for describing the emotional meaning of the emoji (CATA question with 39 terms). The studied emoji spanned a broad range of emotions, which varied in valence (e.g., smiling face vs. angry face) and arousal (e.g., sleepy face and face with stuck out tongue and winking eye). A strong association with one emotion/mood was established for 15 emoji, and associations of lesser strength with several but related emotions/moods was established for 10 emoji. The remaining emoji (n=8) were associated with different moods and emotions, indicating multiple and unrelated meanings. Emoji with similar facial expression had largely similar meanings (e.g., neutral face and expressionless face"	" and the different smiling face emoji). For most emoji, consumers’ interpretations corresponded to meanings listed in internet resources, and there was also concordance between the empirical results and the internet meanings with regard to multiple words being applicable to describing every emoji. Validation of the established meanings is required, and in the future consideration should be given to agreement/disagreement among consumers in emoji meaning. Extension of the research to other consumer populations and emoji is needed."","""",""2017-05-10 09:16:48"",""2017-05-10 09:16:48"",""2017-05-10 09:16:48"","""","""","""","""","""",""Food Quality and Preference"",""Dominant meanings of facial emoji"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""ScienceDirect"","""","""","""",""C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\VF27HNPK\Jaeger et Ares - Dominant meanings of facial emoji insights from C.pdf"	" C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\QDG7A4QW\S0950329317300939.html"","""","""",""Emotion"	 Internet	 Interpretation	 Non-verbal communication	" Social media"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

However, due to the subjective nature of the Twitter datasets, metaheuristic-based clustering methods outperforms the traditional methods for sentiment analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel metaheuristic method (CSK) which is based on K-means and cuckoo search. The proposed method has been used to find the optimum cluster-heads from the sentimental contents of Twitter dataset. The efficacy of proposed method has been tested on different Twitter datasets and compared with particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, cuckoo search, improved cuckoo search, gauss-based cuckoo search, and two n-grams methods. Experimental results and statistical analysis validate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. The proposed method has theoretical implications for the future research to analyze the data generated through social networks/medias.

First, is there information in the online stock message board useful for predicting stock returns? Second, if useful information is found, is it novel or it is simply a different way of expressing information already available in the past behavior of stock prices? To address these questions, we build and validate a series of predictive models using state-of-the-art machine learning and topic discovery techniques. Running experiments in which the models are trained with different combinations of features extracted from the past behavior of stock prices, or mined from the online message boards. Evidence suggests that it is possible to extract predictive information from stock message boards. Furthermore, we find that adding this information improves the performance of classification systems trained solely on technical indicators. Our results suggest that information from online text data is complementary to the one available in the past evolution of stock prices.

The aspects of the environment that could shape language include the social, the physical, and the technological."",""2016-09"",""2017-05-10 09:24:12"",""2017-05-10 09:24:12"",""2017-05-10 09:24:12"",""649-660"","""",""9"",""20"","""",""Trends in Cognitive Sciences"",""Why Are There Different Languages?"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""",""ScienceDirect"","""","""","""",""C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\D7H3BGXT\Lupyan et Dale - 2016 - Why Are There Different Languages The Role of Ada.pdf"	" C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\Z47I36NG\S1364661316301012.html"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""

In this paper we compare the meaning and the usage of emojis across different languages. Our results suggest that the overall semantics of the subset of the emojis we studied is preserved across all the languages we analysed.

This study asked 228 participants for the last time that they used one or more emojis in a conversational message, and collected that message, along with a description of the emojis' intended meaning and function. We discuss functional distinctions between: adding additional emotional or situational meaning, adjusting tone, making a message more engaging to the recipient, conversation management, and relationship maintenance. We discuss lexical placement within messages, as well as social practices. We show that the social and linguistic function of emojis are complex and varied, and that supporting emojis can facilitate important conversational functions."",""2016"",""2017-05-24 07:35:23"",""2017-05-24 07:35:23"",""2017-05-24 07:35:23"",""504–509"","""","""","""","""","""","""",""MobileHCI '16"","""","""","""",""ACM"",""New York, NY, USA"","""","""","""","""","""",""ACM Digital Library"","""","""","""",""C:\Users\morin\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\j6hh9fik.default\zotero\storage\8QZ7NG5K\Cramer et al. - 2016 - Sender-intended Functions of Emojis in US Messagin.pdf"","""","""",""emojis"	 messaging	" mobile"","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""","""""
